title: The Lexer and Parser of InfluxDB
tags: InfluxDB
---

The database folks are familiar with lexer and parsers, since SQL is a language 
widely supported in this area, and it is common wise to write the lexer and parser 
of SQL using yacc/lex or similiar tools. Evidence can be found from many databases
like PostgreSQL, MySQL or many Big Data query engines. In fact, lexer is 
not so complicated to written by hand, while parser is much more tedious. 

InfluxDB is an exception to the list of databases, it uses both a handwriting 
lexer and a parser. This link<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> clearly disribes the reasons behind the 
decision. If it only support simple syntax just like in its early days<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, 
the maintenance burdon is trivial. But if it wants to support the rich feature 
set of standard SQL, then yacc/lex-alike tools may be a better choice.

To help understanding its history, we can dig into the commit logs. The query 
language of InfluxDB is a not standard SQL, but a simpler SQL-alike language 
named InfluxQL, which is described in the influxql/InfluxQL.md file. The
commit<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> on 2016-02-04 changed the readme file's name from InfluxQL.md to 
README.md. While the commit<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> on 2017-10-30 changed the directory 
and moved the parser into its own repository<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. We can see the change
history in the latter repository.

In 2020, InfluxDB announced that it's future version will be influxdb-iox<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>,
a new designed system written in Rust. The reasons behind the decision are 
clearly written in the blog<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>, and it looks more like a classical OLAP
columnal database than a purpose-designed time-series database. It claims to 
be fully compatible with the previous version, but it looks like InfluxQL is 
not supported yet. Instead, it uses Apache DataFusion<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> and the underlying 
Apache Arrow engine to quickly support SQL. Of course, both of them are written 
in Rust.
