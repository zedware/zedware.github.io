title: QEMU Tips
---

The usage of QEMU is not always straightforward. The use case here is starting
yet another Linux server on a ssh-ed Linux server. Summary of the tips is 
followed.

1.  By default, QEMU uses VGA display and expect X Windows.
2.  QEMU can work with ncurses and without X Windows. But it may fail.

The steps I have tried are listed below.

1.  ssh to the existing Linux server.
    
        $ ssh dev

2.  Install qemu 
    
        $ sudo yum install qemu

3.  Download the minimal Ubuntu.
    
        $ wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso

4.  Create the image, which is empty.
    
        $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 mini.qcow2 10G

5.  Try to start the empty image. 
    
        $ qemu-system-x86_64 mini.qcow2 
    
    The qemu process exit with some errors, like.
    
        ** (qemu-system-x86_64:18015): WARNING **: Could not open X display
    
    Add -curses to let QEMU run without X Windows, 
    
        $ qemu-system-x86_64 -curses mini.qcow2
    
    It try to boot the system and failed as expected.

        No bootable device.

6.  Try to boot the image with the iso, but it still failed.
    
        $ qemu-system-x86_64 -curses -hda mini.qcow2 -boot d -cdrom mini.iso
    
    Unfortunately, the screen print several lines of logs, then stop with
    "640 x 480 Graphic mode", if input with some key stokes, it blinks 
    and then changed to "800 x 600 Graphic mode".

7.  But it can boot a existing DOS image.
    
    Download <https://github.com/palmercluff/qemu-images/tree/master/ms-dos-7.10>, 
    and extract it with 7zip.
    
        $ qemu-system-i386 -curses -hda ms-dos-7.10.qcow2
    
    ![DOS](/images/qemu-dos.png "DOS")

    Unfortunately, the latest QEMU installed on macOS can't run the same command.
    And report an error.

8.  Finally, I have to make X Windows ready.
    
    Then run the command without ncurses.
    
        $ qemu-system-x86_64 -hda mini.qcow2 -boot d -cdrom mini.iso
