Visiting Linux from Windows can be made easier since Windows 10 support Ubuntu etc.  In the old good days, we can use Cygwin, MSYS, putty etc. to mimic the Linux environment or visit the Linux boxes. The user experience is not as good as the native Linux.  Now with WSL, the life is changed.

# Useful tools in bash

Most of them works (tmux, jdk) except perf etc.

# X Windows

1.  Install X server like [xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/)
2.  Install and run X11 applications

    $ sudo apt-get install x11-apps
    $ export DISPLAY=:0
    $ xeyes&

If want to display the ssh-ed server's GUI to local desktop, edit its 
/etc/ssh/sshd<sub>config</sub>, turn X11Forwarding on and X11UseLocalHost off.
Or install vncserver on the server, and run vnc viewer on desktop PC.

# Known limitations of bash

Hotkeys like C-c, C-v, C-ins, S-ins not work in early versions.
Maybe it is changed, see [hotkey](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/04/13/copy-and-paste-arrives-for-linuxwsl-consoles/).

# Upgrade Ubuntu

[Upgrade Ubuntu](http://wsl-guide.org/en/latest/update.html)

Because WSL uses the standard Ubuntu installation, upgrading your 
packages should look very familiar:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade

You can aso upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu with the following 
command (caution, this will take quite some time)!:

    $ sudo -S apt-mark hold procps strace sudo
    $ sudo -S env RELEASE_UPGRADER_NO_SCREEN=1 do-release-upgrade

# Difference between drvfs and lxfs

The fstype of Windows is drvfs, while that of Ubuntu is lxfs.
As for MySQL, the data dir should locate on lxfs, if not, 
and put it on *mnt/C* etc., fdatasync() will report errors,
like errno=5.

    1. ./mysql-test-run.pl -boot-gdb # start mysqld under gdb
    2. break at my_fsync
    3. continue to see the error of fdatasync
    4. verify the fs of the data path

Found it by comparing the strace of a test program and mysqld,
then verified by the upper steps.
