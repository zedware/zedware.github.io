title: The RISC-V Memory Consistency Model
tags: RISC-V

The memory consistency model of different hardware is diverse. The future may be unified by sequential consistency model. 
A recent example is [The Memory Consistency Model](https://riscv.org/2017/04/risc-v-memory-consistency-model/) of RISC-V.
I am wondering if RISC-V can be one of the major architectures in the near future.
