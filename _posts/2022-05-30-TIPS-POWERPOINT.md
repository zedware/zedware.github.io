As an Internet-era and Cloud-era engineer, writing presentations with Microsoft
PowerPoint is a missing skill for me. So I was writing down the tips I found helpful here.

# Eyedropper/吸管工具

Right-click on an object like Text, click on Fill and select the Eyedropper
to choose the desired color. Many of the templates provided by the big companies
list the color palette, and Eyedropper can choose the appropriate colors quickly.

取色尤其是按照公司规范取色是非常常见的操作，这时候吸管就很有用武之地了。


# Align objects

Select multiple objects, and choose Home -> Arrange -> Align. It can help us
align the objects left, right, top or bottom. Go through Format -> Align can
do the same. It is not easy to make the objects the same size since there
is no action called "Make the same size." Uses Format -> Shape Height or Shape
Width to input the wanted size.

对齐各种对象是一个基本操作。对于有强迫症的领导或作者来说都是必备利器。


# Remove the animations

If there are any animations on the slide, we can choose Animations -> Animation
Pane to edit them. But there is a particular type of animation for the switch
between slides, which should be edited through Transitions menu.

动画是个很烦人的东西。尤其是页面之间切换时的动画。怎么干掉它们？


# Mark as final

We can protect the presentation by making it read-only or even restricting access.
An attractive option is "Mark as Final," which can tell us it is a final
version.

不管出于什么目的，保护一下文档或者限制下读写权限是 Office 的强大功能。
“标记为终稿”可以避免打开后不小心修改了，或者那些自动更新的日期字段更新了。
